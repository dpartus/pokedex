# Pokedex coding challenge

Additional features

- See all Pokemon with sorting and filtering
- Search by different attributes (color, type, etc)
- Add new, undocumented Pokemon
- Edit exsisting Pokemon
- Breadcrumb for evolution chain page
- Save to favorites list of Pokemon

Assumptions on use cases

- Locations meant areas where this pokemon had been encountered
- Evolution type meant evolution chain with the Pokemon that evolve to and from one another
- Spelling of Pokemmon must be correct in order to receive a result

Other technologies to use

Performance concerns

- none at the moment, but if there are api calls with larger amounts for data then it could take a while (ie. /pokemon)

Visual enhancements

- Improve overall design (I am not the best designer)
- Improve the display of large lists (moves and location)
